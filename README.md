HTML5 Audio Player for the [FIP radio](http://fipradio.fr), hosted on [fip.rbelouin.com](http://fip.rbelouin.com).

/!\ This player is at its early stage and may not work on all browsers

### Intro

Although I am in love with the FIP radio, I don't really like its web player. I want to build mine, and I want it to:

- be more usable with mobile devices
- keep the song history
- save the songs the user likes

### Contribution

Feel free to send PR if you want to contribute!
